# P4wnP1 A.L.O.A. Payloads

All of my payloads use the **DE** (German) keyboard layout.

### How to use my payloads

* HID scripts should be placed in `/usr/local/P4wnP1/HIDScripts`, or you can just copy and paste the scripts to the "HIDScripts" section of the web interface and save them there.
* If you need to install some package on the Pi that requires internet access, please watch [this](https://youtu.be/QEWaIoal5qU) video.

I assume ZERO responsibility for what you do with these payloads.
