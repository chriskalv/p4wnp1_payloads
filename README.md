# P4wnP1 A.L.O.A. Payloads

+ All of my payloads use the **DE** (German) keyboard layout.
+ All processes in the scripts are explained to some basic extent within the source code.
+ Global settings are usually placed at the top of the source code, so you can easily edit the script to your liking.

### How to use the payloads

+ Enable keyboard and USB mass storage capability on your P4wnP1.
+ HIDScripts (the .js files) should be placed in `/usr/local/P4wnP1/HIDScripts`, or can just be pasted into to the "HIDScripts" section of the P4wnP1 web interface.
+ For the extraction of browser-based data (hitory, bookmarks, donwload logs, etc.), download `browser_booty.exe` and copy the file to `/tools/` on your P4wnP1 mass storage device.
+ If internet access is required at any point and you don't know how to proceed, [this video](https://youtu.be/QEWaIoal5qU) explains the connection process fairly well.
